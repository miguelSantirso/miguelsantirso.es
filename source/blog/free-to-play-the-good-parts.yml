title: "Free to play: The good parts"
content: |
I am a game developer at a company that makes 1.5 billion dollars each year with free to play games. Before that I helped create Tiny Thief, one of the best selling premium games the year it came out. I’m still far from being an expert but these two experiences have given me a rather unique perspective on free to play versus paid games (often called premium).

There are many articles listing, describing and analysing why free to play is so bad for the industry… And I have to agree with many of them, especially when looking back at the first wave of free to play games. But I disagree with the general belief that it overall a bad thing for players… In fact, free to play is probably the favourite monetisation method (when implemented correctly) and has many advantages for players. Let me talk about three of them here:

### Try before you pay

Buying premium mobile games is a risky business.

Shortly after buying my iPad I ignored the free to play games and started buying premium games, they cost just a few dollars and they are in Touch Arcade’s “Top Reviews”! I couldn’t be disappointed… right? Well, that phase didn’t last long: I quickly discovered that most of these games were not so good and I was spending an important amount of money in games that I would discard in less than one hour.

It is really hard to find really good premium games on the App Store and that is why today I almost never pay for a mobile game.

My experience with free to play was the opposite: I started avoiding free to play games because I knew most of them were a waste of time but I quickly learned to download a few each month and discard the ones I don’t like in a few minutes.

This is one of the biggest advantages of free to play: It allows players to try the game for as long as they want and then they can choose to pay if they are enjoying the game.

Free to play makes it easy to find the games you like the most and lets you make a more informed decision on whether you want to pay and how much.

### Easier to be social

Isn’t it great when you and your friends play the same game? I always like talking about them, compare the progress, share tricks… This is especially important in multiplayer games (I am looking for Battlefield 4 friends, by the way!)

Free to play makes this a lot easier. Friends or family are much more likely to download a game you are recommending if they don’t have to pay for it.

Look at Clash of Clans: The game is alright when you start playing it but it degrades into a slow, painful grind where you have to wait for days and weeks to complete actions. Only when you connect with players (either real friends or through the clans system) you have enough motivation to put up with the wait times and continue playing (and paying) for months and months. If you are reading this you probably know a group of real world friends playing Clash of Clans or you may even be in one of them! I don’t think this would be possible if you had to pay $5.99 to start playing.

Game of War is another example of an otherwise average game that works extremely well thanks to its huge community and social features.

Finally, let’s talk about Candy Crush. I think it proves this point more than any other game. If you choose to connect with Facebook you are guaranteed to find many of your friends (probably most of them) in there. It is so popular that it is extremely well known outside of the videogame community and is constantly mentioned by people and media. Half a billion people play this game or any of its sisters and brothers every month (compare that with the population of your country, for reference). This would have been impossible if the game wasn’t free to play.

It is sad to see that Candy Crush has not exploited this to its full potential (yet?). Can you imagine how cool it could be to play a really social and multiplayer game that is played by all your friends and family? I think this is the next generation of free to play games and I couldn’t be more excited!

Be prepared for a new generation of free to play games in mobile where you will play with friends for real. As a developer I will try to do my bit to make this happen!

### Fresh games, forever

When you release a premium game you usually get most of your revenue in the first weeks after releasing it. This is specially true on mobile.

For this reason, developers working on premium games have not enough motivation to think of what’s going to happen to the game after the release.

In fact, their motivation is exactly the opposite: They need to start thinking of their next game even before the current one is released. Only if the game is a huge success they will think of working on an update… And that doesn’t seem like the best strategy after what happened with Monument Valley or our own experience trying to sell additional content for Tiny Thief.

When you work on free to play games it works the other way around: The revenue you get in the first weeks is just an experiment (the “soft launch”) and you are only concerned about long term. This makes player retention and satisfaction the only things that matter. If players enjoy the game and stay it shouldn’t be so hard to find a way to get two or three dollars from them!

If you are lucky and everything goes well, money starts pouring in but the competition in this market is voracious. Either you continue working hard on your game or your players will just leave for something else.

Developers have a very strong motivation to improve, update and support their free to play games for as long as they can.

What do the players get? A highly polished game they can download and play for free with their friends that will continue to grow and improve long after they get bored and forget about it.

The main motivation for writing this post was not to defend free to play as the best way to get money from game development. I simply wanted to add some important points to a conversation that has skewed too much towards one side. We all know what the problems of free to play are… Let’s think a bit of what is good about it and how we can use it for whatever comes next.
